1.) In the first folder i describe the actually staus quo.

2.) In the second folder i describe my ideas to adapt the current program with an new POS (point of sales) system.

New Features added / Ideas for new features:

- User issue/user menu should be extended with the corresponding authorisation:
- Issue/return ticket
- Set and delete articles
- Display balance Cash register stock/item stock



------------------------

In the first step, I described the current status of what we have built.

I have created various UMLs for this purpose. Once class diagrams and a flow diagram for the rough flow of the Program.

In the second step, I collected ideas on what else could be added

I thought it would be a good idea to add a kind of cash register system or point of sales system and an internal article management system.

On the one hand, it should be possible to issue tickets to different groups (seniors, kids, etc.) and on the other hand, it should be possible to order and maintain articles. Such as food and tools for the zoo.

From a certain authorisation level, it should be possible to display an overview of the tickets issued and the article stock.
Sie sollten dann in der Lage sein, einen Artikel und einen Kassenbestand anzuzeigen.

I have created class diagrams and a rough flow diagram for this.
